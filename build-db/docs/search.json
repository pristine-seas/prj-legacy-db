Each method has its own sites table that captures location, date, and team metadata, along with method-specific fields (e.g., habitat type, sub dive details).\nStations: Represent the core sampling unit within a site. A site may have one or more stations depending on the method. For example:\n\nUnderwater visual surveys: different depth strata × method (e.g., LPI, BLT)\nSubmersible dives: horizontal transects at different depths.\nPelagic BRUVS: each camera rig in a five-rig set.\n\nObservations: Contain QA/QC’d and minimally processed data recorded at each station — for example, fish counts by species or LPI substrate counts.\nSummaries: Include cleaned, aggregated, or derived data products often used in analysis or visualization. Examples include: biomass_by_taxa (fish), cover_by_taxa (LPI), or sequences_by_taxa (eDNA)\n\nThis four-tier structure helps organize data from field collection to final analysis in a way that is modular, scalable, and aligned with FAIR data principles.",

These method-specific fields provide essential contextual detail such as depth, platform type, habitat classification, or deployment parameters.\nThe following method-specific site tables are currently included in the sites dataset.\n\nUnderwater Visual Surveys\nUnderwater Visual Survey (UVS) sites represent the core spatial unit for SCUBA-based survey methods conducted during Pristine Seas expeditions. These methods include fish belt transects (BLT), benthic line point intercept (LPI), invertebrate counts, coral recruit surveys, and others.\nIn addition to the core site fields, the uvs_sites table includes two key controlled fields used to provide ecological and environmental interpretation of each site. These are:\n\nhabitat:\n\nfore reef: Outer slope of a reef, typically high-energy and wave-exposed.\nback reef: Protected area behind the reef crest, often calmer and more sheltered.\nfringing reef: Reef structure that grows directly from the shoreline.\npatch reef: Isolated, often small reef outcrops within a lagoon or sandy area.\nreef flat: Shallow, flat section of a reef, often exposed at low tide.\nchannel: Natural passage between reef structures or through atolls.\nseagrass: Shallow marine habitat dominated by seagrass beds.\nrocky reef: Hard-bottom habitat composed primarily of rock.\nother: Habitat that does not fit predefined categories.\n\nexposure:\n\nwindward: Side of the island or reef facing prevailing winds and wave energy. Typically higher energy environments with more exposure to ocean swell.\nleeward: Sheltered side, facing away from prevailing winds. Typically calmer, with reduced wave action.\nlagoon: Located within a lagoon system, protected from direct oceanic exposure. Often shallow and calm, with restricted circulation.\nother: Exposure type does not fit standard categories (e.g., enclosed bays).\n\n\nAdditional fields include a site_name (often used for repeat surveys), the name of the local community (where relevant), protection status, and flags indicating which UVS sub-methods were conducted at each site (Table 3.2).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Additional fields to the core site fields in the uvs_sites table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable\nField\nType\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nuvs\nsite_name\nSTRING\nFALSE\nSite name used in prior surveys or local knowledge (e.g., TNC_2000_001, Punta Esperanza)\n\n\nhabitat\nSTRING\nTRUE\nDominant habitat type.

These sites represent individual stationary stereo-video deployments, typically conducted at depths from 10 to 70 meters.\nEach site corresponds to a single BRUV deployment, meaning that site and station are effectively one-to-one for this method.\nIn addition to the core site schema, the sbruvs_sites table includes method-specific descriptors (Table 3.4):\n\nhabitat – Same controlled vocabulary as uvs_sites, with the following additional values: bay, estuary, mangrove, sand flat\nexposure – Same vocabulary as uvs_sites.\n\nDeployment-specific details such as depth, rig ID, and camera identifiers are stored in the associated sbruvs.stations table.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.4: Additional fields to the core site fields in the sbruvs_sites table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable\nField\nType\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nsbruvs\nhabitat\nSTRING\nTRUE\nSimplified habitat classification at the site.

Each site corresponds to a single 5-rig deployment set, with each rig treated as a separate station. As such, the pbruvs_sites table contains one row per deployment set, while rig-specific data are recorded in the corresponding pbruvs.stations table.\nIn addition to the core site schema, the pbruvs_sites table summarizes deployment metadata across all five rigs in a standardized way (Table 3.5):\n\nn_rigs – Number of rigs deployed (typically 5)\ndrift_m – Mean drift distance (meters) across rigs\ndrift_hrs – Mean soak time (hours)\nuwa_string_id – String (site) identifier used by the University of Western Australia\n\nLatitude and longitude represent the mean start position across all rigs, and time fields reflect the start time of the first rig.

Each site corresponds to a single station, representing the full transect.\nAlthough transects are mobile, the ps_site_id is anchored to the start point of the transect to provide consistent spatial referencing across the dataset.\nIn addition to the core site schema, the bird_sites table includes a site-level descriptor for habitat, using a custom controlled vocabulary tailored to these surveys:\n\nopen ocean – Offshore transects over deep water, far from land or coastal influence\n\ncoastal – Nearshore waters along mainland or island coastlines\n\ninshore – Sheltered bays, estuaries, or nearshore zones with limited wave exposure\n\nisland – Terrestrial habitats on offshore islands, often with seabird nesting colonies\n\ninland – Land-based habitats far from marine influence (e.g., wetlands, forest, grassland)\n\nother – Rare or unique environments not captured by the categories above\n\nTransect-specific metadata — including platform type, duration, distance traveled, and species observations — are stored in the corresponding birds.stations and birds.observations tables.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.6: Additional fields to the core site fields in the birds_sites table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable\nField\nType\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nbirds\nhabitat\nSTRING\nTRUE\nBroad classification of the survey environment.

The site corresponds to the full ROV dive (deployment), while each station represents a horizontal transect or observational segment within the dive. This structure follows the standard Pristine Seas convention: sites capture high-level spatial and temporal metadata, while stations contain transect-specific sampling and observation data.\nThe rov_sites table records the core spatial and temporal metadata for each ROV deployment. Deployment start time (time_deploy) and coordinates (lat_deploy, lon_deploy) are used to populate the standardized core fields time, lat, and lon, ensuring consistency across methods.\nMethod-specific metadata—such as recovery time and coordinates, dive_type, max_depth_m, duration, and highlights—are retained within the rov_sites table (Table 3.7).\nTransect-specific information, including start/end depth, time, coordinates, and observation notes, is stored in the corresponding rov.stations table.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.7: Additional fields to the core site fields in the rov_sites table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable\nField\nType\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nrov\ndive_type\nSTRING\nFALSE\nPurpose of the dive (e.g., transect, exploration, sample collection)\n\n\ntime_deploy\nTIME\nTRUE\nTime ROV left the surface\n\n\nlat_deploy\nFLOAT\nTRUE\nLatitude at ROV deployment\n\n\nlon_deploy\nFLOAT\nTRUE\nLongitude at ROV deployment\n\n\ntime_recovery\nTIME\nFALSE\nTime ROV returned to the surface\n\n\nlat_recovery\nFLOAT\nFALSE\nLatitude at ROV recovery\n\n\nlon_recovery\nFLOAT\nFALSE\nLongitude at ROV recovery\n\n\nmax_depth_m\nFLOAT\nTRUE\nMaximum depth reached during the dive\n\n\nduration\nTIME\nFALSE\nTotal duration of the dive (hh:mm:ss)\n\n\nhighlights\nSTRING\nFALSE\nNarrative summary or scientific highlights of the dive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmersible\nEach submersible dive is represented by a single site with one or more associated stations. The site corresponds to the entire submersible deployment (dive), while each station represents a horizontal transect or visual survey segment conducted during that dive.\nThe sub_sites table captures the spatial, temporal, and operational context of each dive. In addition to the standardized core fields shared across all site tables, it includes method-specific metadata relevant to submersible operations—such as the submersible name, dive_type (e.g., science, media, policy), max_depth_m, observers, pilot, and precise timestamps for key waypoints (e.g., time on bottom, surface recovery).\nTo maintain alignment with the shared site schema:\n\nThe start of descent provides the time, lat, and lon used in the core fields.\nThe primary scientific observer (observer_1) is mapped to team_lead.\n\nTransect-specific information, such as start/end depth, time, habitat descriptions, and notes, is stored in the corresponding sub.stations table.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.8: Additional fields to the core site fields in the sub_sites table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable\nField\nType\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSubmersible\nsub_name\nSTRING\nTRUE\nName of submersible used (e.g., Argonauta or DeepSee)\n\n\ndive_number\nSTRING\nFALSE\nRunning sub dive number\n\n\ndepth_max_m\nFLOAT\nTRUE\nMaximum depth reached (m)\n\n\nduration\nTIME\nTRUE\nTotal dive duration (hh:mm:ss)\n\n\ntemp_max_depth_c\nFLOAT\nFALSE\nTemperature at maximum depth (°C)\n\n\nobserver_1\nSTRING\nFALSE\nPrimary scientific observer\n\n\nobserver2\nSTRING\nFALSE\nSecondary observer (if any)\n\n\npilot\nSTRING\nFALSE\nSubmersible pilot\n\n\ndive_type\nSTRING\nFALSE\nType of dive.

In line with the Pristine Seas schema, the site captures the spatial and contextual metadata of the deployment, while the station represents the full observational unit — including technical specifications, environmental conditions, and recording parameters.\nThe dscm_sites table records the core spatial and temporal metadata for each deployment. Deployment time (time_deploy) and coordinates (lat_deploy, lon_deploy) populate the standard core fields time, lat, and lon, following conventions used across all methods.\nDeployment-specific details — such as max_depth, bottom temperature, ambient water temperature, recovery time and position, and recording duration — are stored in the corresponding dscm.stations table.",
